					<h2>Create an HTML file to run tests &amp; view results</h2>
					
					<p>
						Woosh is designed to be included within another project
						to make speed testing easier.
					</p>
					<p>
						Any HTML file will do, a good example can be found at
						<a href="../../exampletests/template/index.html">exampletests/template/index.html</a>.
						The only requirements are including woosh.js and a div
						with ID 'wooshOutput'.
					</p>
					
					<h2>Creating tests</h2>
					
					<p>
						Tests can be created with a call to {+ new Link().toSymbol('woosh.addTests') +}
						per library you want to test. See the API documentaion
						for details and exampletests/template for a working example
					</p>
					
					<h2>What can be tested?</h2>
					
					<p>
						By default, the amount of time a function takes to execute
						becomes the result of the test. However, you can record
						a different result yourself (eg, framerate) and provide
						that as the result. See {+ new Link().toSymbol('woosh.Test#result') +}
						for details.
					</p>
					
					<h2>Writing a good test</h2>
					
					<p>
						Here are some quick tips for writing a good test:
					</p>
					
					<h3>Make sure each test takes longer than 300ms to run</h3>
					
					<p>
						JavaScript timers are only accurate to about 15ms, so
						the longer your test runs the more accurate the result
						is.
					</p>
					<p>
						The best way to achieve this is via the loopCount parameter
						of {+ new Link().toSymbol('woosh.Test') +}.
					</p>
					
					<h3>Keep tests realistic</h3>
					
					<p>
						Eg. don't test the speed of creating 10000 elements unless
						that's a likely use of your code.
					</p>
					<p>
						Browsers optimise for common uses, sometimes at the expense
						of slowing down extreme cases. If you make an extreme test
						the results are unlikely to reflect the results of normal use.
					</p>
					
					<h3>Don't open debugging tools</h3>
					
					<p>
						Tools like firebug and web inspector will affect test
						results. Unless you're wanting to test the effect of
						firebug / web inspector on your code, don't open them.
					</p>

					<h2>Not quite ready yet!</h2>
					
					<p>
						I'm still working out the API for this.
					</p>
				</if>
				<if test=" data.mode == 'fullApi' ">
					<h2>The inner workings of Woosh</h2>
					
					<p>
						This full API reference includes 'private' methods and
						properties which may change without notice.
					</p>
					<p>
						This set of documentation is aimed at people who wish
						to contribute to Woosh.
